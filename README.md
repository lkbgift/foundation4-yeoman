# [Yeoman 1.0 and Foundation 4.1.2+](https://github.com/lkbgift/foundation4-yeoman)

Yeoman is a robust and opinionated client-side stack, comprising tools and frameworks that can help developers quickly build beautiful web applications.

Foundation self declares to be the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world.

## Explaination

Yeoman is very useful to scaffold a ready-to-go frontend development environment. Yeoman gives you a seamless build process. Foundation is a easy to use front-end prototyping framework. When paired, they provide a great starting point for any web application.
